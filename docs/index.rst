Welcome to OVM
==============

OVM (Open Virtualization Manager) is a tool that allows you to create
and manage VMs. This version of OVM can handle the hypervisor KVM with
libvirt. This tool must run directly on the hypervisor.

This tool is delivered with few drivers to handle networks and storage
system but you can build easily your own scripts.
